# StackRox Default Authorization Plugin

The Default Authorization Plugin can be used to demonstrate, test, and deploy
the Scoped Access Control feature of the StackRox Kubernetes Security Platform.

This software bundle, along with its documentation, covers *only* the plugin side
of the Scoped Access Control feature. For implications of using an Authorization Plugin
in the StackRox Container Security Platform, as well as for information on how to configure
StackRox to use an Authorization Plugin, refer to the StackRox product documentation.

The documentation for this software artifact is contained in the `docs/` directory. We
recommend for you to start with the [overview](docs/overview.md).
